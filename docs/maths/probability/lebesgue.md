# **Lebesgue Measure**

Lebesgue measure plays a role in handling the Dirac delta function ($\delta$-function) in the context of the Central Limit Theorem (CLT), particularly when working with continuous random variables and their distributions. {==Dirac delta function==} is a probability distributions that are contcentrated at single point, and it leads to discontinuty of distribution.
