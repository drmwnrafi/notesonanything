# **Random Variables**

Random variable ($\mathbf{X}$) is a function that assigns a numerical value to each outcome of an event in a sample space, quantifying a specific characteristic of the outcomes.

$$
\mathbf{X} : \Omega \rightarrow \mathbb{R}
$$

Read by : function $\mathbf{X}$ maps outcomes from sample space $\Omega$ to real number $\mathbb{R}$, where each outcome $\omega \in \Omega$ in $\Omega$ donated by $\omega$.

- **Continuous Random Variables** : possible value range in continuous (countable number), e.g lifetime of transistors
- **Discrete Random Variables** : possible value range in discrete (countable number), e.g. n coin flips

## **Probability of Random Variables**

Probability of random variables $P(\mathbf{X})$ is a function to determine the distribution associated with the random variable. Probability Mass Function (PMF) for discrete and Probability Density Fuction (PDF) for continuous. To that, we need :

1. Particular value or falling within a certain range $\mathbf{X}$
2. Probability of each value over $\mathbf{X}$ 

## **The Importance of Random Variables**

1. Summary of the probabilities with function of $P(\mathbf{X})$, without counting probability from each n-trails one by one
2. PDF can modeled a random process, because we can modeled the distribution so it's allowed us to test hypothesis
3. More ease to visualize and compute certain value in PDF
4. Build new function on $\mathbf{X}$, e.g. $\mathbf{X}^2$, $E(\mathbf{X})$, $Var(\mathbf{X})$
